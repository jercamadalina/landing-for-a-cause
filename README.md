# Landing for a Cause

## What are you going to learn?

- How to plan a landing page.
- How to create a wireframe.
- How to implement a whole website.

## Tasks

1. Choose an NGO, which could use a better website.
   - There is a clear topic, who is the subject of the website
   - There is an introduction of the NGO in the projects `README.md` file at the top

2. Like any real life project, an NGOs website should be also planned well.
   - There is a low-/mid-fidelity wireframe created and saved in the repository (as an image)
   - The wireframe was reviewed before any implementation started

3. You have great freedom on this project. Follow the linked articles on how a great landing page looks like and implement what is necessary for your chosen NGO to gain conversion.
   - There is a nice and clean landing page for the selected NGO

## General requirements

- Use only native HTML and CSS, no 3rd party stuff, nothing else
